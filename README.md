# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Project Description
Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns in age, gender, class, fare, and family structure.

# Visualizations Included

1. Survival by Gender (Countplot)
2. Age Distribution (Histogram)
3. Fare by Passenger Class (Boxplot)
4. SibSp Distribution (Histogram)

# Key Findings

- Females had higher survival counts.
- Most passengers were aged 20–40.
- 1st class passengers paid the highest fares.
- Most passengers traveled alone (SibSp = 0).

# Tools

Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

# Summary of Findings

- Based on the selected visuals:
- Gender was a key factor in survival rates.
- The passenger age range was concentrated among young adults.
- Higher socio-economic class corresponded to higher fare values.
- Most passengers were traveling alone, based on SibSp values.
